                    Writing excellent essays for university can be hard, but doesn't have to be! The most common essay type that is written in college or university is argument/persuasive essay.<br>In an argument essay you need to argue a point, usually based on a reading or on the learned material. First thing you will need is a Thesis Statement.<br>Introductory paragraph<br>Thesis statement is a sentence which is inserted at the end of your first paragraph of the essay and basically states your argument. For example: "Rolelessness of teens in society, men not doing enough at home, declining job security and adolescents' exclusion from adult activities are all responsible for causing stress in families."<br>Prior to the thesis statement you should go over the findings or the material that you've read and state your 3 main points, which we will get to in a moment.<br>Main points formation<br>How you form the three main points will be dependent on the question your teacher asks you to answer. My sample thesis statement above probably is aimed at answering: "Why do teens face stress in our society?" Therefore, my main points are part of the thesis statement already: 1) Rolelessness of teens in society; 2) Men not doing enough at home; 3) Declining job security; 4) Adolescents' exclusion from adult activities. In this case, I have four main points, but the standard is three. Your main points must be formed on your research and must support your thesis statement.<br>Second paragraph<br>The second, third and fourth paragraphs are focused entirely on your main points - one paragraph for each point. The second paragraph should state your <em>first main point</em> upfront and then talk about it and the supporting evidence you've found in your reading/research. You will need <em>three supporting points</em> to support the main point. From the example above, the first main point is: Rolelessness of teens in society. The supporting points on which I will elaborate are: 1) Teens are not allowed to work in our society; 2) Families may give individual tasks as needed to children, but this is not universally practiced by all in our society; 3) Teens are not allowed to have a family of their own at a young age, so they are denied the experience of being responsible for others. You should have three supporting points to support your main point. If you can't find three, you must have a minimum of two supporting points, but you will need to expand how much you talk about each one to fill the space in the essay. If you can't find two supporting points, then your main point is too weak and you may want to change the main point to something else.<br>Third paragraph<br>Same as the second paragraph, but states your <em>second main point</em> and then talks about it.<br>Fourth paragraph<br>Same as the second and the third paragraphs, but states your <em>third main point</em> and then talks about it.<br>Conclusion paragraph<br>The conclusion paragraph can be almost same as the first introductory paragraph. You will need to lead with a summary statement, such as: "In this essay we've discussed the many reasons the teens in our society experience stress." It summarizes generally what you've talked about. Then re-state your <em>three main points</em> and conclude with a re-written thesis statement. From the example above it may be something like: "All of the above are responsible for causing stress in families."</div>

You can do a translation of your favourite English song! It's a great technique for learning colloquial English. The steps are: 1) Go to Google.com; 2) Type the name of your favourite song + lyrics. Example of this is: "Aerosmith - Dream On lyrics." This will locate for you the lyrics of the song. 3) Follow the link and print out the lyrics page, then translate to your language. What this exercise will help you do is learn some common phrases from your favourite songs, which you can use when talking to others! Fun and educational!</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="carousel-item slider-fullscreen-image active" data-bg-video-slide="false" style="background-image: url(assets/images/mbr-1-1920x1281.jpg);"><div class="container container-slide"><div class="image_wrapper"><div class="mbr-overlay"></div><img src="assets/images/mbr-1-1920x1281.jpg"><div class="carousel-caption justify-content-center"><div class="col-10 align-left"><h2 class="mbr-fonts-style display-1">Tip 2: Learn some fancy words</h2><p class="lead mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-5">Learning fancy words can give you a certain class! It will make you appear smart when you use them - just try not to appear too smart! To easily find fancy words for what you want to say, we turn to Google again: Type in Google "synonyms to + whatever word you want to use." Example: "synonyms to however". Follow one of the links and you will find many ways to say the word. Usually synonyms can be used interchangeably. Some synonyms are old words and no one uses them anymore, so it may be a good idea to check if someone still uses these with a teacher or a tutor, or simply research on Google. Even if it would be hard to use the fancy words in speech with your international friends, you can use them to great effect in your writing, such as college essays!</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="carousel-item slider-fullscreen-image" data-bg-video-slide="false" style="background-image: url(assets/images/3.jpg);"><div class="container container-slide"><div class="image_wrapper"><div class="mbr-overlay"></div><img src="assets/images/3.jpg"><div class="carousel-caption justify-content-center"><div class="col-10 align-right"><h2 class="mbr-fonts-style display-1">Tip 3: Reading books</h2><p class="lead mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-5">Reading English books is again a great way to learn some basic or advanced vocabulary! This is one of the ways that significantly advanced my own vocabulary. If you are a beginner and not sure which book may be good to read, go to a public library. Ask the librarian where you can find teenager section. Books for teenagers are easier to read than books for adults. They are also much shorter! Some of them are great stories too and have won awards! If you find reading teen books difficult, you can also try children's books. You may borrow books from library, or find a used books store and buy one or two. Importantly, when you are reading an English book and find a word you don't know, write it down and find its' meaning. Hang the paper with written words and translations on to your wall and look at them and try to memorize them. This is a good way to expand your vocabulary!</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><a data-app-prevent-settings="" class="carousel-control carousel-control-prev" role="button" data-slide="prev" href="#slider1-e"><span aria-hidden="true" class="mbri-left mbr-iconfont"></span><span class="sr-only">Previous</span></a><a data-app-prevent-settings="" class="carousel-control carousel-control-next" role="button" data-slide="next" href="#slider1-e"><span aria-hidden="true" class="mbri-right mbr-iconfont"></span><span class="sr-only">Next</span></a></div></div>
